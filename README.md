# Prediction-of-Movie-Ratings-Using-Artificial-Neural-Networks

Worked on a dataset which consists of
several features such as language, genre, release year, region,
ratings and cast member roles. The goal of the project is to
predict the rating of a movie, based on the historical statistics
of the above-mentioned features. Upon doing sufficient Data
pre-processing which included Data Cleaning, Exploratory
Data Analysis and Feature Selection, I obtained an
appropriate data set structure. 

Using the dataset, I applied
various Machine Learning models and tried several Artificial
Neural Network Architectures to find the best
model/architecture that sufficiently predicts the rating of a
movie released. Some of the machine learning models used
include Gradient Boosting Regressor, Support Vector
Regressor, Linear Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent
Regressor and the ANN included architectures included a
combination of dense layers along with combinations of dense
layers and a dropout. 


An ANN architecture with a
combination of dense layers performed best in predicting the
ratings using the dataset used.
